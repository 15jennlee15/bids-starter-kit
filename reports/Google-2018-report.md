## The Big Picture

An open source project is one where code and some data is shared publicly. 
Rather than the traditional approach of hiding processes and making them exclusive, open science principles 
prioritize transparency, diversity, and reproducibility to foster collaboration.

Imagine you are a carrot farmer trying to make dinner. You could make carrot soup by yourself, but you could also share ingredients 
with the neighbours to make a much tastier soup with onions, greens, and some salt. Some people may be able to contribute more than others -- but everyone benefits.



In neuroscience, data such as magnetic resonance images and physiology readings can be costly in both time and money to acquire. This creates a barrier for many underfunded researchers without access to the required equipment. Responsible data sharing can level the playing field, but incompatible specifications cause portability issues between different labs and scientists. The brain imaging data standard (BIDS) is a framework for organizing data that standardizes datasets across different researchers to enable easier sharing.

## Our role

The primary goal of this project was to simplify the process of learning about BIDS and engage more users. Well before it was funded by Google, the roots of this initiative were being pioneered by a small group of people around the world that were acting as local BIDS ambassadors in their communities. Many of us were already giving presentations at every workshop and conference possible. However, these were only for a limited audience, and there was a need for central organization. We hoped to create a central repository accessible to everyone that would contain easy to read documentation and a collection of useful resources. 


## Problem definitions and solutions

The title of this project was called Easy BIDS: Starter Kit, and that’s exactly the question that we started with: 

How do we make this data standard easier to adopt?

From there, we broke it down into a series of more discrete problems.

<br>

:o: **Problem** Which parts of BIDS are people finding most difficult?

:heavy_check_mark: **Solution** Through both formal surveys and informal chats, we got feedback from the newcomers to BIDS. The results showed that people were most confused by the technical jargon and metadata file formats.

<br>

:o: **Problem** The technical documentation about BIDS can be overwhelming.

:heavy_check_mark: **Solution** We developed an easy to read reference called the BIDS Starter Kit Wiki. What started as a two page document quickly grew into a compilation of information, tutorials, examples, a glossary, publications, community resources, and many more.

<br>

:o: **Problem** Engage more users

:heavy_check_mark: **Solution** In person, our team continued to spread the word about the project during any relevant events. Online, we created an animated video to summarize the general idea and make the first step that much easier. We also used the “good-first-issue” principle to periodically leave small mistakes in our repository unfixed, such as a typo or an undefined term in the glossary. Then, we would send out a request and guide a new contributor through the process of using the repository. 

As a result, the number of unique visitors grew from less than 5 to peaks of over 50 per day.

<br>

:o: **Problem** International project management and communication

:heavy_check_mark: **Solution** The members and collaborators of this project were located in Canada, Britain, the Netherlands, the USA, and India. The strategy for this problem was to work publicly. This meant rather than waiting until completion to share something, we would continuously post our work in progress and incorporate feedback. Specifically, Github milestones and “closing soon” tags were helpful to highlight weekly tasks and mark them for review. 

Despite these strategies, I still felt that the turning point of the project was in June when some of our team finally met in person. Summarizing an unnecessary meeting into a message is efficient, but familiarity is really important too.

## Personal notes

Four months ago, as an electrical engineer, a community development job might have meant laying power transmission lines to a new town. Now it means making sure people don’t get lost on their way. The toughest part at first was definitely the uncertainty -- a document doesn’t have errors and nobody leaves detailed feedback about why they /didn’t/ feel welcomed. But I’m glad to have finally learned the natural continuation of what happens as a tool reaches maturity. To every mentor, collaborator, administrator, and user that has been a part of this project so far, thank you for all the help and feel free to message because I’ll still be staying involved!
